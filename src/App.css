/* The TM3 window is 1260px by 924px, but we'll use a flexbox display system to
avoid having to hard code the size. This will also allow us to fit content into
the screen, as opposed to having the content dictate the size of the app's display.

The padding values give the appearance our content is equidistant from
the top browser controls and the sides of the browser window  */
